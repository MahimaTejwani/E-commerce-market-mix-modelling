As an **expert in marketing analysis**, I propose an **advanced approach** for optimizing **ElecKart's marketing budget**, leveraging a comprehensive **market mix model**. This model will scrutinize the impact of various marketing activities over the previous fiscal year (July 2015 - June 2016) to inform strategic budget allocation for the upcoming year.

The dataset encompasses key variables such as **SKU identification (FSN ID)**, **order dates**, unique order and item IDs, **Gross Merchandise Value (GMV)**, **unit sales**, **payment types**, **delivery SLAs**, **customer IDs**, **product MRP**, and **procurement SLAs**. Additionally, it includes **monthly expenditures** on diverse advertising channels, **special sale days**, **monthly NPS scores**, and the company's **stock index** on a monthly basis.

For this analysis, I will focus on creating market mix models for three specific product subcategories: **camera accessories**, **home audio**, and **gaming accessories**. These models will be constructed at a granular, **weekly level**.

In terms of **feature engineering**, recognizing ElecKart's location in Ontario, I will integrate regional **climate data** to examine potential influences on revenue trends. This will involve creating numerous features from the available data, including **macro-economic variables** such as daily climatic information. Additional features will include flags for **pay dates** (notably the 1st or 15th of each month) and **holidays**.

The **exploratory data analysis** phase will entail comprehensive **univariate, bivariate, and correlation studies**, along with **cross-tabs and visualizations**. This will help in garnering insights and shortlisting variables for modeling, leading to the creation of pertinent **KPIs**. The rationale behind the selection of these KPIs will be meticulously documented.

For the **modeling phase**, I will construct and compare various models - **basic, logarithmic, and multiplicative** - to analyze the influence of different attributes on the target variable. The evaluation of these models will be grounded in **robust metrics** to ensure accuracy and relevance.

Finally, the **presentation of results** will involve a detailed explanation of the most effective models for each product subcategory. This explanation will be tailored to the **CMO and CFO**, ensuring intuitive comprehension of the variables and their significance in forecasting sales. Any **surprising or unexpected trends** identified will be highlighted for strategic consideration.

This sophisticated, data-driven approach aims to maximize the efficacy of ElecKart's marketing investments, aligning with the company's goal of optimizing revenue response through strategic budget reallocation.
